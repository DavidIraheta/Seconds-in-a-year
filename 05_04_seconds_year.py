# Use the interpreter to calculate how many seconds are in a year.
# Then write the code in this script file below this line
# Number of days in a year = 365
# Seconds in a day = minutes 60 * 60 seconds a minute = 3600
# 3600 seconds * 24 hours in a day 
# Number of seconds in a day multipled by days in a year 
print(3600*24)
